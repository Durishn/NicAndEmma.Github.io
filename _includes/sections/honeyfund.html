	We are honored you will share in our special day - your presence is our gift! We're lucky to already have a home full of many of the things we need. However if you'd like to contribute funds to help with the cost of the wedding, honeymoon or student debts, we will be accepting gifts at the event. Thank you! <br>
	Thank you!
