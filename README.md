# Wedding Website for Nic and Emma 2019

This website is powered by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) and jekyll, and is heavily adapted from [markcerqueira/wedding-site](https://github.com/markcerqueira/wedding-site), which was heavily adapted from [menzenski/wedding-site](https://github.com/menzenski/wedding-site). Thanks so much to those who have contributed to this theme before me, let the open source train continue to roll.

To run locally use: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
To build use: `bundle exec jekyll build`
